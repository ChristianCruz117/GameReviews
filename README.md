# Details
- Game Title: Marvel's Spider-Man
# Summary
The game is about the life of Peter Parker, aka Spider-man, as he is older, more mature, and has been crime fighting for many years now. 
Spider-man is trying to find the leader of the demon clan that is terrorizing New York City before they can release a bio-weapon. The 
gameplay gives you a lot of options on what to do and fighting many enemies. As you travel around the city swinging from building to 
building, your mission as a comic book crime fighter include fighting bosses, thugs, drug lords, and a gang called the demons. You can 
basically go around collecting collectibles while hunting down villians to take them down. 
# Final Thoughts
All the game was missing was amazing in the title. I loved the gameplay, how the characters are introduced, and how it is action packed. 
The game draws you in mainly because of the story and has you wondering "Why are these things happening?" Also, the tasks the game 
gives you are challenging and entertaining. What I really loved about this game was the webbing and how the graphics looked. He swings
fluidly from one part of the city to another. Its truly the best spider man game they have ever made.
